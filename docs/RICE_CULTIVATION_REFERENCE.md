- **Active Tillering** (Day 21-30): 30-40 kg N/ha
- **Panicle Initiation** (Day 45-50): 30-40 kg N/ha, 30 kg K2O/ha

**Total per season**: 90-120 kg N/ha, 30 kg P2O5/ha, 60 kg K2O/ha

## Water Management

### Based on PhilRice Water Management Protocols

1. **Seedling Stage**: Saturated to 2cm depth
2. **Vegetative Stage**: 3-5cm continuous flooding
3. **Reproductive Stage**: 5-10cm continuous flooding
4. **Ripening Stage**: 
   - Early ripening: 2-5cm
   - Late ripening: Gradual drainage
   - Final 7-10 days: Complete drainage

## Pest and Disease Management

### Common Issues by Stage

#### Vegetative Stage
- **Stem borer**: Monitor at 25-35 days
- **Leaf folder**: Check weekly
- **Brown planthopper**: Begin monitoring at 30 days

#### Reproductive Stage
- **Rice bug**: Critical at flowering
- **Blast disease**: Monitor during heading
- **Bacterial blight**: Prevent with proper nitrogen management

#### Ripening Stage
- **Rice grain bug**: Most critical threat
- **Birds**: Implement bird scaring at 80% maturity

## Variety-Specific Considerations

- **Yield potential**: 5-6 tons/ha
- **Grain quality**: Premium quality, good eating quality

**Special Notes**:
- Moderately resistant to blast and bacterial blight
- Susceptible to brown planthopper - monitor closely
- Responds well to balanced fertilization

### NSIC Rc160
**Source**: PhilRice Technical Bulletin Rc160

- **Maturity**: Earlier than Rc222 by 4-9 days

- **Best for**: Irrigated lowland with good water control
- **Yield**: 5.0-6.0 tons/ha
- **Special care**: Requires consistent water management during reproductive stage

## Direct-Seeded vs Transplanted Methods

### Direct-Seeded (Dry)

**Advantages**:
- Labor-saving (no seedling production)
- Faster establishment
- Lower cost

**Key Activities**:
- **Day -7**: Land preparation and leveling
- **Day -3**: Pre-germinate seeds
- **Day 0**: Direct seeding at 80-100 kg/ha
- **Day 7-14**: Early weed control critical
- **Day 21**: First top dressing

### Transplanted Method
**Source**: PhilRice Transplanting Guidelines

**Advantages**:
- Better weed control
- More uniform stand
- Traditional method

**Key Activities**:
- **Day -21**: Prepare seed bed
- **Day -18**: Sow in seed bed
- **Day 0 (Day 21 from sowing)**: Transplant seedlings
- **Day 7 after transplant**: Gap filling
- **Day 14**: First top dressing

## Climate and Seasonal Considerations

### Wet Season (June-November)
**Source**: DA-PhilRice Seasonal Rice Production Guide

- Higher disease and pest pressure
- More cloud cover affects photosynthesis
- Adjust fertilizer rates (reduce by 10-20%)
- Enhanced drainage needed

### Dry Season (December-May)
**Source**: PhilRice Dry Season Management

- Better grain quality potential
- Lower pest pressure
- Higher fertilizer efficiency
- Irrigation management critical
- Watch for water stress

## Technology Integration

### Smart Farming Recommendations
**Source**: PhilRice Digital Agriculture Program

1. **NPK Sensors**: 
   - Check weekly during vegetative stage
   - Bi-weekly during reproductive and ripening

2. **Water Level Monitoring**:
   - Maintain optimal depth per stage
   - Implement AWD (Alternate Wetting and Drying) to save water

3. **Weather Integration**:
   - Adjust activities based on forecasts
   - Delay fertilization during heavy rain

4. **Growth Stage Tracking**:
   - Monitor daily to adjust activities
   - Document actual vs. expected progress
